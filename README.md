Zappos-GiftFinder
=================

This is the program I made as part of Zappos's challenge for their Summer Internship program

About
================

This is a simple app that will prompt you for a number of products and a maximum price that combination should meet, and then it'll produce a list of Zappos products that meet those requirements. To help do this, I needed Google's GSON class to convert the JSON that is obtained from using API calls into a list of objects that I can use. Running it should be as simple as downloading the files and running the Tester class using an application like Eclipse or BlueJ

Note/Bugs
================

Unfortunately I became sick last week and between getting over it and catching up with classes, this program still has a lot of bugs and works, but doesn't work as well as it should. Details are in the program itself but if you're too lazy for that just know that for some reason counting the total price of a list of items is not producing correct results.

However I am now over my cold and I promise that I will update this project by the end of next week and that update will include a program that works 100% as it should and maybe have some extra functions if I have the time

Credit
================

I have never learned how to use API in Java, or anything really, so I turned to the Internet for help and I'd like to acknowledge the places that gave me help here:

ianb821 - Zappify-Java project - I'll be honest here, I used a lot of your code to get me off the ground and start learning how to use API, specifically Zappos's. I copied some of your methods, (for example your httpget method) while trying to add my personal touch to them so I wasn't copying them completely. Its thanks to you that I learned about GSON and how it can help me with my project. I couldn't have done it without your code and for that I thank you
